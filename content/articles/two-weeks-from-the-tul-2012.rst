We are two weeks from the TUL and this is the last few days to register (please
do so on the `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/tryton/wiki/Liege2012>`_ or by
`email <mailto:info@b2ck.com>`_).

As last year there will be around 30 people attending the unconference. Some
talks were already proposed like ‘What's new in Tryton 2.6’, ‘What's next for
Tryton’, ‘Python 3: Status of the port’ and ‘`A Tryton client for Android
<http://trac.scil.coop/tryton_android/wiki>`_’, a workshop on `Nereid
<http://nereid.openlabs.co.in/>`_ is also planned.

This meeting of Tryton Developers from all around the world (people are coming
from as far as India or Argentina) will also be the occasion to talk about non
technical subjects like the Tryton Foundation and what should be done to
improve the Tryton “marketing”.

So if you are belgian or live near Liège, do not hesitate to drop by the `Youth
Hostel "Simenon" <http://www.laj.be/introduction,473?lang=en>`_ on the 9th and
10th of November to get your share of python and tryton talks and drink a beer
(or two).
