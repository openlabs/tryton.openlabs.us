This year the annual `Tryton <http://www.tryton.org/>`_ `Unconference 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>`_ will take place in `Barcelona 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona>`_ the 8th, 9th and 10th of November. 

In this third global meeting you will have the opportunity to gather together 
community members (both users and developers), to talk about the future of 
Tryton and of course to discover the city of Barcelona.

Until now, the following talks are proposed:

- How to release module
- Why you should not do localization modules?
- A documentation framework
- Tryton from a user point of view
- GNU Health status
- Roundtable about the future development

The first Foundation Supporter Meeting will take place on Saturday 9th, 18.30 
at the same place of the Unconference.

We have reserved Sunday 10th for a `Coding Sprint
