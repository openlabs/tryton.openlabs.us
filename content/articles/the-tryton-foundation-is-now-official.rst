After more than a year of preparation, the Tryton Foundation is now official
and fully operational. It is a Belgian private foundation, hence it is
designated to pursue a specific disinterested purpose. The missions of the
foundation are:

    * Develop and support conferences, meetings and community activities,
    * hold and administer the tryton.org infrastructure,
    * organize the community of supporters,
    * and manage and promote the Tryton trademark.

The initial board of manager is composed by: Albert Cervera i Areny, Bertrand
Chenal, Nicolas Évrard, Cédric Krier,  Sebastián Marró, Udo Spallek and Sharoon
Thomas.

The foundation is already `accepting donations
<http://foundation.tryton.org/#how-can-i-donate>`_, so if you rely on the
Tryton project please help the foundation to pursue its missions.

The supporters candidacies are `opened since last week
<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tryton/GTe2cclTSmk/discussion>`_.The role of
the supporter assembly is to represent the Tryton community inside the
foundation.

All those information are gathered on http://foundation.tryton.org/. This page
will evolve over time and will welcome the list of supporters and donators.
